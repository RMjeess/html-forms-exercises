This is part of a series of auto-graded exercises to practice HTML & CSS. Credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy">4Geeks Academy</a>. These are the solved exercises. I will continue to come back and try them out again. The difficulty of the exercises increases progressively, so it is recommended that they're solved in this order. Check out their beginner-friendly docu for more details!

You can find the links to the original repos and my latest solutions below, respectively.
